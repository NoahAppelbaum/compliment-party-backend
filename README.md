### Compliment Party Backend

# About
This is the development backend for Compliment Party, a web app where a group of people can all give eachother anonymous compliments, for a community-building, feel-good experience. Groups can join individual rooms with live participant updates via websockets.

# Technologies Used
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Socket.io

# Future Plans
Once this development build is up and running, the plan is host this websocket server on the cloud. The next planned step is serverless functions, to retrieve compliments from past parties from a data layer, so that returning users can look at them in the future.
